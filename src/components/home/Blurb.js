        Oh hello there and welcome ! My name is <strong>Karim Cheurfi</strong>.
        I'm a <strong>full stack software developer</strong> based in{" "}
        <strong>Paris, France</strong>. I've been writing code professionally
        for <strong>5 years</strong> now, and as a hobby since I was 8. My
        languages of choice are{" "}
        <strong className="fuschia">Python and Node.js</strong> (in that order)
        but I have a sweet spot in my heart for C (I should also probably
        mention that I've dabbled in Golang and PHP in the past).
